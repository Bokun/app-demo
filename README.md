# app-demo

This is a demo app for the Bokun app store. 
It's purpose is to show you how to implement the OAuth process.

## 1. Setting up a tunnel to localhost
You need to set up tunnel using a tool like `ngrok` (https://ngrok.com/) to localhost so that the app store can access your app via a public URL.
Assuming you will be running this app on `localhost` port `8181`, you create a tunnel using:

`ngrok http 8181`

This will create a public URL for your app, which will tunnel to port 8181 on your localhost. 
Let's assume the URL looks like this:

`https://{id}.ngrok.io`

## 2. Configure and run the demo app
Open `conf/application.conf` and configure the following parameters: 

1. Bokun URL. This should point to the URL of the Bokun environment you are running.
If you are using Bokun test environment, then set this to `"https://%s.bokuntest.com"`

    * `bokun.url = "https://%s.bokun.io"`  

2. App URL. This should point to the URL of where your app is running

    * `app.url = "https://{id}.ngrok.io"`

3. App credentials. They can be found on the bottom of your app dashboard in the Bokun Partners site.

    * `app.apiKey = bb5d27dda5a24c4eaf8263ac5a5054f8`
    * `app.secretKey = 834404ae8e22453e967adcc6d6f95d93`

4. App permissions. The access scope that your app will request when a vendor installs.

    * `app.permissions = "VENDOR_USERS_READ,BOOKINGS_READ,CHECKOUTS_READ,CHECKOUTS_WRITE"`

Once you have configured these settings and saved `conf/application.conf`, start the app by running the following command in the app-demo folder:

`sbt run` 

## 3. Configuring the app URL in the Partner Dashboard
The final step is to tell BÃ³kun the URL where your app is running. 
In the Bokun Partner Dashboard, in your app settings, you should set the following URLs:

**App URL** 

`https://{id}.ngrok.io/`

**Whitelisted redirect URL**

`https://{id}.ngrok.io`

Now you're good to go - have fun!
